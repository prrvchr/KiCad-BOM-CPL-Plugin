## KiCad python plugin that generate BOM and CPL files for JCLPcb, LCSC and even any other supplier... such as Farnell.

# KiCad BOM CPL Plugin v0.0.5

### Install:

- Download the [plugin](https://github.com/prrvchr/KiCad-BOM-CPL-Plugin/archive/v0.0.5.zip)
- Unzip and put the plugin file `bom-cpl-plugin.py` in your KiCad working directory.
- In KiCad open Eeschema go to BOM (Generate Bill Of Materials) and add A New Plugin


### Use:

#### Required Eeschema custom fields:

It is necessary for the operation to add 4 additional custom fields in Eeschema, which are:
- `Manufacturer`
- `PartNumber`
- `Supplier`
- `SupplierRef`

The required field `Supplier` must be set to one of the predefined supplier (LCSC or JLCPcb for example) or any other supplier name case insensitive.

The required field `SupplierRef` can be replaced by other custom fields such as: `LCSCRef` or `JLCPcbRef` in order to make possible the referencing of several suppliers on a Eeschema component.
In this case, changing the value of the `Supplier` field will allow you to switch to the correct supplier reference automatically.

#### Optional Eeschema custom fields:

Two additional fields can be add to an Eeschema componant, witch are:
- `Quantity`
- `Rotation`

The optional `Quantity` field allow to manage the quantities in Eeschema.
In the absence of this field, the default quantity is 1.
If value is set to 0 or is invalid, the component will not be integrated to any BOM file...

The optional `Rotation` field allow to correct rotation, if needed when generating the CPL file...

#### Customisation:

If necessary, a grouping is carried out on the quantities, making it possible to generate a single row for identical components in the BOM file.

If you know a little Python, the grouping and the order of the components in the BOM files is fully configurable ...

When launching the plugin (in Eeschema BOM) it will create as many BOM files as there are different `Supplier` encountered.

In order to generate a BOM file for several pieces, it is possible to add a quantity argument at the end of the plugin command line (ie: `"bom-cpl-plugin.py" "%I" "%O"  100` for 100 pieces).
If the supplier is not configured for regrouping, or without this argument or with an invalid value, a default quantity of 1 will be used.

It also creates the CPL file for JLCPcb from one of the position files found in the working directory (ie: `your_project-all-pos.csv`, `your_project-top-pos.csv`, `your_project-bottom-pos.csv`).
A correction on the rotations will be made according to the `Rotation` field of each component.

### Predefined suppliers:

This plugin has been configured to work with LCSC, JLCPcb and also with many other suppliers ...

#### LCSC configuration:

CSV BOM file columns:
- Quantity
- Manufacture Part Number
- Manufacturer
- Description
- LCSC Part Number
- Package

CSV BOM componants are grouped by same PartNumber and SupplierRef

CSV BOM componants are order by: Manufacturer, PartNumber

No CPL file will be generated.

#### JLCPcb configuration:

CSV BOM file columns:
- Comment
- Designator
- Footprint
- LCSC Part #

No CSV grouping is performed, in the absence of a BOM Quantity column

CSV BOM componants are order by: SupplierRef

CPL file will be generated if a position file can be found.

#### Default configuration:

This configuration applies to all other suppliers (other than LCSC, JLCPcb)

CSV BOM file columns:
- Quantity
- Manufacture Part Number
- Manufacturer
- Description
- Supplier Part Number
- Package

CSV BOM componants are grouped by same PartNumber and SupplierRef

CSV BOM componants are order by: Manufacturer, PartNumber

No CPL file will be generated.
